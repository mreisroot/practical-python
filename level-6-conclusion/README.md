# Best Practices with Python

1. Respect the naming conventions

Ex: Use underscore to separate words in variables

Ex: Use capitalized words for classes names

Doing this will force you to be consistent, it will make your life easier when reading code from others who are also respecting those conventions, and it will make other people's life easier when reading your own code.

The conventions are simply here to facilitate collaboration, so use them properly.

2. Give meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, etc.

If you need to read a temperature, then name the variable temperature, and not tprt, or just tpt, for example.

3. Be careful with the identation

Python relies on identation to make sense of the code you write. So, always double-check that what you want to write in a block of code is actually inside that block of code, and not somewhere else because the identation is not correct.

4. Don't repeat yourself

Use loops, functions, and if needed classes whenever you can.

Create building blocks and reuse them, instead of writing the same code all over again.

5. Keep things simple!

It's not because your application is complex that your code should be over complicated.

Think before you write code, and write just what you need; You don't create the foundation for a castle, when what you really need is a wood cabin.

So, don't over optimize your code, and actually, don't optimize at all before you really need to. Keep things simple when you code, go to the point, and focus on solving the problems you need to solve and no more.

6. Search on Google

Practice searching on Google. This is a real skill, that, unfortunately, is completely underestimated by many people.

Being good at programming doesn't mean you know all the functions of all languages by heart. Being good at programming is about being good at solving real problems using code, and a part of that is searching on Google whenever you don't know something. In fact, if you ask any developer out there, what they mostly do in a day, they're probably going to tell you "well, I search stuff on Google".

You don't need to know everything, but you need to know how to search for information and how to apply that information to solve a given problem. This is the real value of a great developer.
