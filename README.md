# Practical Python

This project contains the code I've written during the "Practical Python: Learn Python Basics Step by Step - Python 3" course at [O'Reilly Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com).

This course introduces Python from the very beginning, from running commands in the Python Interpreter to the basics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
